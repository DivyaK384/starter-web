Cheras
Muvendars (Three Great Kings) controlled the territories of Tamizhagam during the
Sangam Age. The Tamil word ‘Vendar’
was used to refer to three dynasties,
namely the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas.
The Cheras ruled over the central and
north Travancore, Cochin, south Malabar
and Kongu region of Tamil Nadu. The
Pathitrupathu (a collection of ten decades
of verses) provides information about the
Chera kings. It is known that the Chera
king Senguttuvan went on a military
expedition to North India. He brought
stones from the Himalayas for making the
idol of Kannagi, an epic character from
Silappathikaram. He introduced pattini
cult. CheranSenguttuvan’s younger
brother was IlangoAdigal. He was the
author of Silappathikaram. Another Chera
king, CheralIrumporai, issued coins in
his name. Some Chera coins bear their
emblem of bow and arrow.
