Cheras
Muvendars (Three Great Kings) controlled the territories of Tamizhagam during the
Sangam Age. The Tamil word ‘Vendar’
was used to refer to three dynasties,
namely the Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas.
The Cheras ruled over the central and
north Travancore, Cochin, south Malabar
and Kongu region of Tamil Nadu. The
Pathitrupathu (a collection of ten decades
of verses) provides information about the
Chera kings. It is known that the Chera
king Senguttuvan went on a military
expedition to North India. He brought
stones from the Himalayas for making the
idol of Kannagi, an epic character from
Silappathikaram. He introduced pattini
cult. CheranSenguttuvan’s younger
brother was IlangoAdigal. He was the
author of Silappathikaram. Another Chera
king, CheralIrumporai, issued coins in
his name. Some Chera coins bear their
emblem of bow and arrow.

Status of Women
There was no restriction for women in
social life. There were learned and wise
women. Forty women poets had lived
and left behind their valuable works.
Marriage was a matter of self-choice.
However, chastity (karpu) was considered
the highest virtue of women. Sons and
daughters had equal shares in their
parents’ property.

Festivals and Entertainments
People celebrated several festivals. The
harvest festival, (Pongal) and the festival
of spring, kaarthigai, were some of them.
Indira vizha was celebrated in the capital.
There were many amusements and
games. This included dances, festivals,
bull fights, cock fights, dice, hunting,
wrestling and playing in swings. Children
played with toy cart and with the sand
houses made by them.

Art:

There are many references to variety
of musical instruments such as drum,
flute and yazh. Karikalan was master of
seven notes of music (EzhisaiVallavan).
Singing bards were called panar and
vraliyar. Dancing was performed by
kanigaiyar. Koothu (folk drama) was the
most important cultural practice of the
people of Sangam Age. They developed
the concept of Muthamizh (Iyal, Isai,
Naatakam).
